Refreshing an image with jQuery
===============================

This is some code I used to refresh an image on a website without the need to refresh the whole page. 
This is useful if you are using a camera that is overwriting an image every time with the same image name.

Normally you would see jQuery using the $ as a function or variable name. Since I was using this with a WordPress implementation, jQuery is already running in "noconflict" mode.

If you do not know about jQuery.noConflict() and why it is used.. check out the documentation at:
[http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/)

###Instructions:

* Replace "URL_TO" to be the url to the image
* Replace "ID_OF_IMAGE" to be the id of the image
